League of Legends champion app

https://ayydre.github.io/lol-app/

This app has all the champions in League of Legends and shows a few of their stats. (Attack dmg, Magic dmg, Defense, Difficulty and Type)

I used the league of legends api, 'https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/10.16.1/data/en_US/champion.json' , to pull all of my information regarding each champ. Also used Html, Css, and Javascript for this app.

In the future I would like to add videos of each champion attached to their modal and also suggested build paths.
